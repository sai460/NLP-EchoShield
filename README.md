# EchoShield: Intelligent Detection of Extremist Content

## Project Overview
EchoShield is a multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed to identify extremist content across diverse languages. Leveraging the state-of-the-art XLM-RoBERTa model, this project focuses on robust preprocessing, fine-tuning for binary classification, and ethical considerations in automated content moderation.

## Features
Multilingual support using XLM-RoBERTa.
Comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline.
Fine-tuning transformer models for classification.
Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Scalable architecture for diverse deployment scenarios.
